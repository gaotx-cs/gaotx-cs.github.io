Welcome! Iâ€™m Tianxiang (å¤©ç¿”), but feel free to call me Adamâ€”Iâ€™m happy with either! Since July 2024, Iâ€™ve been an Assistant Professor in the [School of Computing](https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/Pages/School-of-Computing.aspx) at [DePaul University](https://www.depaul.edu/Pages/default.aspx).

ðŸŽ“Before joining DePaul, I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science with a co-major in Applied Mathematics from [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/), where I was co-advised by [Dr. Hongyang Gao](https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/hygao/), [Dr. Hailiang Liu](https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/hliu/), and [Dr. Jia (Kevin) Liu](https://kevinliu-osu.github.io/). My academic journey began with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Yantai University](https://www.ytu.edu.cn/).

## Research 

ðŸ’¡My research focuses on **deep learning theory**, **generative AI**, and **graph representation learning**. I enjoy exploring fundamental problems that mysteriously arise from real-world applications and offering insightful guidelines to advance practice.

ðŸŒŸ<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Immediate Openings!</span> 
- I am recruiting Ph.D. students starting in Fall 2025 and Winter 2026. 
- I am looking for multiple Research Assistants (RAs) for Spring 2025 and Summer 2025 to work on projects in deep learning theory and graph representation learning.
