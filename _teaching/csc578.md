description: >
  This course covers the foundations of deep learning, including fundamental neural network architectures (e.g., multilayer perceptrons) and training methodologies, including advanced optimization techniques (e.g., momentum, RMSprop, Adam). It also addresses generalization and regularization strategies (e.g., overparameterization, the double descent phenomenon, and weight decay). We will explore cutting-edge neural network architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers (e.g., GPT and BERT), and graph neural networks (GNNs). Students will gain hands-on experience by implementing these models and applying them to real-world problems in computer vision, natural language processing, and graph machine learning.

## Prerequisites
- [CSC 412](https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/pages/courseinfo.aspx?Subject=CSC&CatalogNbr=412) provides basic knowledge in linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and probability.
- [DSC 478](https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/pages/courseinfo.aspx?CrseId=012551) or [CSC 480](https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/pages/courseinfo.aspx?CrseId=001513) introduces the fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
- You will implement and train deep neural networks using PyTorch, so basic Python proficiency is required.

## Textbook
No textbook is required. Materials will be drawn from classical books and recent papers. Recommended readings:  

- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen  
- [Deep Learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville  

A list of key papers in deep learning will also be provided.

## Grading
- **Quizzes:** 25%  
- **Programming Assignments:** 35%  
- **Midterm:** 20%  
- **Final Project:** 20% (Proposal: 8%, Final Report: 12%)  

Only the best **5** out of 10 quizzes and assignments will count toward the final grade.
