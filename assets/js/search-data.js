We will explore cutting-edge neural network architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformers (e.g., GPT and BERT) with attention mechanisms. Students will gain hands-on experience by implementing these models and applying them to real-world problems in computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and computational biology.
